    "## Data Leakage in Train–Test Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is data leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data leakage** occurs when information from the **test set** or from the **future** is used—directly or indirectly—during model training. As a result, model performance appears much better than it truly is and fails to generalize to real‑world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rule of thumb:** if the model has access to information during training that would not be available at prediction time, there is data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is data leakage a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a train–test split is to simulate unseen future data. When leakage occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test data is no longer independent\n",
    "- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, RMSE, MAPE, …) become overly optimistic\n",
    "- Model comparison becomes invalid\n",
    "- Deployed models often perform poorly\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common types of data leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Leakage through preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong approach:**\n",
    "- Scaling, imputing, or encoding using the **entire dataset** before splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct approach:**\n",
    "- Split the data first\n",
    "- Fit preprocessing steps **only on training data**\n",
    "- Apply the learned transformations to both train and test data\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Best practice: use machine‑learning **pipelines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Target leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Target leakage happens when features contain information that is a direct or indirect consequence of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (kijkcijfers):**\n",
    "- Predicting tomorrow’s viewers\n",
    "- Using features such as daily ranking, total daily viewers, or advertising revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ These values are only known after broadcast\n",
    "✅ They must not be used for prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Time‑based leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Common in forecasting problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong:** random train–test split across time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct:** chronological split\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train: past data\n",
    "- Test: future data\n",
    "\n",
    "> Always respect the arrow of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Leakage via feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Leakage can occur when engineered features use future information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Using season‑wide averages to predict early episodes\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use rolling or expanding statistics limited to past data only.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Leakage via duplication or grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurs when similar or related observations appear in both train and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Different episodes of the same TV show in train and test\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Use group‑based splitting (e.g. by program or show).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to detect data leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is this feature available at prediction time?\n",
    "2. Does preprocessing use test‑set statistics?\n",
    "3. Am I using future information?\n",
    "4. Are the results suspiciously good?\n",
    "\n",
    "🚩 Extremely high performance is often a warning sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to prevent data leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split data **before** preprocessing\n",
    "- Use pipelines for transformations\n",
    "- Avoid random splits for time‑dependent data\n",
    "- Carefully justify every feature\n",
    "- Document assumptions about data availability\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### One‑sentence definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Data leakage occurs when information that would not be available at prediction time is used during training or evaluation, leading to overly optimistic performance estimates.**"
